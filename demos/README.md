# Demos and benchmarks

Use this set of folders to submit demonstrations, benchmarks, texts, etc.  

## Guidelines

None really, except to do something cool, and reproducible.  Ideally it would also be code where someone else could adapt it easily for testing with alternative tools.

## Instructions

1. Clone or fork the repo locally.

2. Create a subdirectory for your demo.

3. Create your demo in that subdirectory, and name it `README.Rmd`.

4. Include the data needed for knitting the `.Rmd` file.  If this is not possible, suggest a way for others to obtain this data (for instance a Dropbox link sent upon request.)

5. Knit the document so that it produces `README.md`.  This will render as HTML when viewed in a web browser directly from GitHub.

6. Issue a pull request, and we will pull it into the repo!
