# Japanese Language Demo by amatsuo

In this demo, I will show processing of Japanese Congressional Speech data through `quanteda` (and `kaigiroku`).

### Install `kaigiroku` package

This package is to access the API of Kokkai Kaigiroku, conference minutes of Japanese National Diet. The API documentation is available [here](http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/api.html) (only in Japanese).

You can install a developer version by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("amatsuo/kaigiroku")
```

At the moment, the package provide only the functionality to download conference minutes of specific meetings (e.g. Budget Committee (予算委員会) and Plenary Meeting (本会議)) for a specified period. 


## Demo for [textworkshop2017](https://github.com/ropensci/textworkshop17)


### Download Conference Minutes

```{r}
require(kaigiroku)
# the following line will download all speeches at plenary meetings in the 
# Upper House (参議院) from Jan 1 to Jan 31, 2017. 
plenary_speeches <- get_meeting(house = "Upper", startDate = "2017-01-01", 
                                endDate = "2017-01-31", meetingName = "本会議")

# the following line will download all speeches at the budget committee meetings in 
# the lower house meetings
budgetcom_speeches <- get_meeting(house = "Lower", sessionNumber = 185, 
                                  meetingName = "予算委員会")

# the following line will download all speeches at the budget committee meetings in 
# the Prime Minister's Questions (or Party Leader Debate, "国家基本政策委員会合同審査会")
# qt_speeches are used in the later part of demos
qt_speeches <- get_meeting(house = "Both", sessionNumber = 190, 
                           meetingName = "国家基本政策委員会合同審査会")
head(qt_speeches)

```

### After getting speeches

Using the power of `quanteda` (and `stringi` for boundary split), you can easily work with the texts and run analyses. 

First, we need to remove unnecessary text sections unique to Japanese conforence minutes.

```{r}
require(quanteda)
require(stringi)
require(dplyr)

# delete header
qt_speeches <- qt_speeches[qt_speeches$speaker !="", ]
# delete speeches by the chair of the meeting
qt_speeches <- qt_speeches[grep("^○会長", qt_speeches$speech, invert = TRUE), ]

# revmove non-speech part
qt_speeches$speech <- stri_replace_all_regex(qt_speeches$speech, "^○\\S+\\s+", "")
qt_speeches$speech <- stri_replace_all_regex(qt_speeches$speech, "（.+?）|〔.+?〕", "")
qt_speeches$speech <- stri_replace_all_regex(qt_speeches$speech, "^\\s{2,}.+\n", "")
```


Now, generate corpus.
```{r}
# generate quanteda corpus object
data_corpus_qtspeech <- corpus(qt_speeches$speech, 
                               docnames = paste(qt_speeches$speaker, qt_speeches$speechOrder),
                               docvars = qt_speeches[, c(1:5, 8:9)])
summary(data_corpus_qtspeech)

# kwicly look at some key terms
kwic(data_corpus_qtspeech, "政府", window = 4) # government 
kwic(data_corpus_qtspeech, "経済", window = 4) # ecnomy
kwic(data_corpus_qtspeech, "成長", window = 4) # growth
```

Generate `dfm` and remove stopwords etc.
```{r}
require(readtext)
# generate tokens and then dfm 
data_dfm_qtspeech <- tokens(data_corpus_qtspeech, remove_punct = TRUE) %>% dfm()
#topfeatures(data_dfm_qtspeech, n = 100)

# remove stopwords and punctuations (using slothlib list http://www.dl.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/slothlib/)
# Warning: the word list removes potentially important words
jpstopwords <- readtext("http://svn.sourceforge.jp/svnroot/slothlib/CSharp/Version1/SlothLib/NLP/Filter/StopWord/word/Japanese.txt")
jpstopwords <- tokens(jpstopwords[jpstopwords != ""]) %>% as.character
# remove stopwords
data_dfm_qtspeech <- dfm_remove(data_dfm_qtspeech, features = jpstopwords)

topfeatures(data_dfm_qtspeech, n = 20) # still a lot of unnecessary features

# remove entries only with hiraganas (ひらがな)
data_dfm_qtspeech <- dfm_remove(data_dfm_qtspeech, features = "^[あ-ん]+$",
                                 valuetype = "regex")
print(data_dfm_qtspeech)
topfeatures(data_dfm_qtspeech, n = 20) #looks better

par(family = "HiraKakuProN-W3") # this line is necessary if you use a Mac
textplot_wordcloud(data_dfm_qtspeech, min.freq = 6, random.order = FALSE,
                   rot.per = .25, 
                   colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8,"Dark2"))

```

### Topicmodeling

We are going to esitmate an LDA topic model. First regenerate dfm at sentence level
```{r}
data_corpus_qtspeech_sent <- corpus_reshape(data_corpus_qtspeech, to = "sentences")
data_dfm_qtspeech_sent <- data_corpus_qtspeech_sent %>% tokens(remove_punct = TRUE) %>% dfm
data_dfm_qtspeech_sent <- dfm_remove(data_dfm_qtspeech_sent, features = jpstopwords)

# remove entries only with hiraganas (ひらがな)
data_dfm_qtspeech_sent <- dfm_remove(data_dfm_qtspeech_sent, 
                                     features = "^[あ-ん]+$",
                                     valuetype = "regex")
```

Run the model
```{r}
require(topicmodels)

model_lda_qt_speeches <- LDA(convert(data_dfm_qtspeech_sent, to = "topicmodels"), 
                             k = 6)
get_terms(model_lda_qt_speeches, 10)
# topics(model_lda_qt_speeches, 3)

```
